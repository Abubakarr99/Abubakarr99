# Resume
I am a DevOps engineer with a strong background in systems and network administration. I am passionate about cloud technologies and deploying and architecting legacy applications to run in the cloud or cloud native Infrastructures.

I love to volunteer in school and my local community helping high school students in Mathematics. I'm grateful for this opportunity to help mentor the future generation. 

I love playing football ⚽ with friends. I have gained a lot discipline and team building spirit by playing this incredible sport.
Fun fact, I know the capital city of every country in the world 🌐.
